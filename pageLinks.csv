CSIS is a separate employer and is not subject to the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA). CSIS has its own classification, compensation system, and a different staffing regime. As such, we use a different staffing process and terminology.

As a separate employer, CSIS has implemented a Directive on COVID-19 vaccination that is consistent with the overall Government of Canada approach to the COVID-19 vaccination of public servants. Applicants to this staffing process should be aware that all employees of CSIS are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 unless accommodated based on a medical contraindication, religion, or another prohibited ground for discrimination as defined under the Canadian Human Rights Act. As such, all persons to be appointed to CSIS will be required to attest to their vaccination status no later than on their first day of employment.

CSIS is committed to building a workforce that is truly representative of the Canadians it serves by cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace environment. This will be achieved by increasing employment equity group representation (including persons with disabilities, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, and women) at all levels within the organization through hiring and talent management practices. We will also ensure that appropriate accommodations are made (e.g., specialized equipment, changes to physical workspace) to provide employment opportunities for all qualified candidates. In support of achieving a greater, diverse and skilled workforce, we strongly encourage those individuals who belong to one or more of the employment equity groups to self-identify when applying.

Should you require accommodation in relation to a disability, please tell us at the beginning of the selection process. This information will be kept confidential.

The personal information provided in your application is protected under the Privacy Act and will be held in Personal Information Bank SIS/P-PU-025.
We thank all applicants for their interest in CSIS. However, only those who are selected for further consideration will be contacted.Hiring InsightsJob activityPosted 10 days ago"
